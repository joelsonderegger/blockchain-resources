## Tokens
What is a (blockchain) token?
A token is a digital asset that can be transferred between two parties over the internet without requiring the consent of any other party. There are many different types of  tokens, each with varying characteristics and uses. Some blockchain tokens, like Bitcoin, function as a digital currency. Others can represent a right to tangible assets like gold or real estate.  

Different kinds of tokens:
- Tokens based on new chains and forked Bitcoin code: Dogecoin ( changed parameters in the Bitcoin codebase) Cash and Dash (innovated on privacy-preserving features) Litecoin (simple tweaks to Bitcoinâ€™s code)
- Tokens based on new chains and new code: Ethereum
- Tokens based on forked chains and forked code: Ethereum Classic (based on a hard fork of the Ethereum blockchain) 
- Tokens issued on top of the Ethereum blockchain: Golem and Gnosis

### Crowd Sale
Kickstarter-style crowdfunding in which internet users at large have the opportunity to purchase tokens.

### ICO (Initial Coin Offering)
How are tokens created?
Tokens are created and distributed to the public through an Initial Coin Offering (ICO)

### Token Launch
[Token launches](https://news.earn.com/thoughts-on-tokens-436109aabcbe) can be an alternative to traditional equity-based financings.

### Private Keys
What do token buyers actually buy? The essence of what they buy is a private key. For Bitcoin, this looks something like this:

You can think of a private key as being similar to a password. Just like your private password grants you access to the email stored on a centralized cloud database like Gmail, your private key grants you access to the digital token stored on a decentralized blockchain database like Ethereum or Bitcoin.

## Smart Contract
What is a smart contract?

## Mining
What is minig?
There are computational tasks involved in adding blocks of transactions to the blockchain. Computers that voluntarily perform these tasks get a reward in from of cryptocurrencies. For security reasons, miners compete to complete these tasks first and win these rewards. This effort is referred to as mining.
